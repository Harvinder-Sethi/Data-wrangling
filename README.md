## Data-wrangling

Hello 
In this git you will basically learn the following :- 
1.	Accurately, logically and ethically combine data from multiple sources to make suitable for statistical analysis and draw valid interpretations.
2.	Articulate how data meets the best practice standards (e.g. tidy data principles).
3.	Select, perform and justify data validation processes for raw datasets.
4.	Use leading open source software (e.g. R) for reproducible, automated data processing.
5.  Few more data wrangling steps with complete explanation and code.

To run the MARKDOWN file :- Open R Studio -> File -> Open File -> select destination and open -> Goto Session -> Restart R and Run all chunks.  BAM !! 

Dataset source:- https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays

Note:- I would assume you know the basics of R and how to use R studio.
